      <blockquote>Human interaction is what makes life meaningful, so what happens when a global pandemic requires us to stay away from
          one another? This website attempts to fill the void caused by COVID-19, and to spread awareness of the severity of the disease
          through personal stories. By clicking through and reading about people just like yourself from all walks of life and all corners
          of this earth, we hope that you can learn something about this virus, and join in the shared emotions that we're all having at
          this time.
